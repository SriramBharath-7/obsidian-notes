# 🛡️ Disaster Recovery (DR) & Business Continuity (BC) – Overview


## 📌 What Are DR and BC?

- DR and BC are essential for organizational resilience against major disruptions.

- While related, they serve different purposes:
  - **Disaster Recovery (DR)** focuses on restoring IT systems and data.
  - **Business Continuity (BC)** ensures overall business operations continue during/after disruptions.

- Disruptions can include:
  - Natural disasters (earthquakes, floods)
  - Man-made incidents (fires, terrorism)
  - Cyberattacks or tech failures

## 🧠 Analogy: Hosting a Concert

### 🎤 Disaster Recovery

- Like bringing an **umbrella** and **backup generator** to a concert.

- Responds after something breaks — protects equipment from rain, powers lights during outages.

- In business: recover critical systems (servers, databases) quickly to reduce downtime.

### 🎭 Business Continuity

- Like having a plan to **move the concert indoors** or switch to an acoustic set.

- Ensures the show continues no matter what happens.

- In business: enables ongoing operations via remote work, alternative suppliers, or backup locations.

## 🔁 Key Differences

| Aspect                 | Disaster Recovery (DR)                  | Business Continuity (BC)                        |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Primary Focus          | Restore IT systems & data               | Maintain business operations                    |
| Trigger                | Typically after a major event           | During and after any disruption                 |
| Scope                  | Technology-centric                      | Organization-wide (people, process, tech)       |
| Goal                   | Minimize downtime & data loss           | Keep business running                           |

## 🛠️ Components of a DR/BC Strategy

- **Risk Assessments**: Identify potential disruptions and impact

- **Critical Systems Identification**: What must be restored first?

- **RTO (Recovery Time Objective)**: How fast should recovery occur?

- **RPO (Recovery Point Objective)**: How much data loss is acceptable?

- **Backup & Replication**: Regular data backups and mirrored systems

- **Failover Plans**: Automated or manual switch to backup systems or cloud environments

- **Alternative Workflows**: Remote access, alternate vendors, or temporary locations

---

## 🧩 Responsibility

- Led by a **Business Continuity Manager** or similar role.

- Involves collaboration between:
  - IT teams
  - Executive leadership
  - Operations
  - Security and risk managers

- **Penetration testers** help by:
  - Identifying vulnerabilities in DR/BC processes
  - Testing the resilience of systems and failover procedures

---

## 🧪 DR/BC Testing

- Regular testing ensures readiness.

- Common test types:
  - **Tabletop Exercises** – Simulate and walk through scenarios
  - **Partial Failover** – Switch individual services to backups
  - **Full-scale Simulation** – Run entire org from alternate systems

- Testing frequency depends on:
  - Business size
  - Complexity
  - Regulatory requirements

- Annual testing is a common baseline.

---

## 🎯 Why DR and BC Matter

- Prevent massive financial losses

- Maintain **customer trust**

- Fulfill **regulatory compliance**

- Preserve **brand reputation**

- Keep mission-critical services operational in any crisis
